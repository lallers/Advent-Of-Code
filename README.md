# Advent Of Code
Every year Advent of Code releases a series of puzzles with varying complexity that first and foremost require problem solving skills. These are my solutions to the puzzles and written fairly quuickly with less emphasis on optimization or performance. My goal is to use either a weak language, a new language, or a language that i need to brush up on to complete the majority of the puzzles!

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) was developed by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/)

_I would like to iterate through these overtime to increase performance and optimization_
